# Build components
This doc introduces how to build all components from source code.

## Architecture

### BLS Signature Aggregation Mode

The following components is required

1. Run as an operator
    1. mach-operator-node
    2. mach-operator-verifier

2. Run whole system in local testnet
    1. mach-operator-node
    2. mach-operator-verifier
    3. mach-operator-aggregator
    4. mach-avs-contracts

### ZK Proof Mode

Comming soon

## Code Repositories
1. mach-avs: [https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs](https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs)

    In this repo, we have following components:

    1. mach-operator-node

    2. mach-operator-aggregator

        > Notice: `mach-operator-aggregator` will migrate to other respository soon.

    3. mach-avs-contracts

2. mach: [https://github.com/alt-research/mach](https://github.com/alt-research/mach)

    In this repo, we have following components:

    1. mach-operator-verifier

## Compile
1. `mach-avs`

    For mach-avs, it is mainly written in `solidity` and `go`.

    For the steps to compile this repo, please check [mach-avs#build-and-run](https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs/blob/m2-dev/README.md#build-and-run)

2. `mach`

    For mach, it is mainly written in `rust`.

    For the steps to compile this repo, please check [mach#compile](https://github.com/alt-research/mach/blob/master/README.md#compile)

## Run

Supported technology stack:

|                                       | Opstack(Optimism) | Orbit(arbitrum) |
| :------------------------------------ | :---------------: | :-------------: |
| BLS Signature Aggregation Mode        |   supported       |   comming soon  |
| ZK Proof Mode                         |   comming soon    |   not supported |

### OP Stack (BLS Signature Aggregation Mode)

#### Run as Operator

For OP Stack based rollup, user needs to prepare the `genesis.json` file and the endpoint of this rollup.

1. `genesis.json`:

    1. If this chain is an "[op superchain](https://app.optimism.io/superchain/)", and has existed in [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), you can use the latest to `op-geth` ([op-geth/releases](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth/releases)) to get the `genesis.json` file.

        ```bash
        ./geth  dumpgenesis  --op-network=<network name, e.g. op-mainnet>  > genesis.json
        ```
    2. If this rollup is not part of OP Superchain or cannot be located in [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry), please ask the project team for help to get the `genesis.json` file

    3. For `op-mach`, this `genesis.json` does not need to field `alloc`, thus, if the field is empty in this file is also ok.

2. endpoint of this rollup:

    1. The chain id from this endpoint must need to match the chain id in the `genesis.json`. i.e., This endpoint must belong to this rollup.

    2. We highly recommend that you run `op-mach` and this rollup fullnode within the same network as it reduces network latency, especially when you set `safe` or `strict` in the `config.toml` file for `op-mach`. (refer to [mach#configuration](https://github.com/alt-research/mach/blob/master/README.md#configuration))

##### Prepare

1. mach-operator-verifier: `op-mach` can be found in the `mach` repo.

2. mach-operator-node: `mach-operator` can be found in the `mach-avs` repo.

##### Run

1. Run `mach-operator-verifier`

    1. To prepare the `config.toml`, please refer to [mach#configuration](https://github.com/alt-research/mach/blob/master/README.md#configuration)

        Please notice the `url` must be pointing to the RPC endpoint of this rollup.

    2. Launch the `op-mach`

        ```bash
        ./op-mach -c <config.toml> --genesis-config <genesis.json>
        ```

2. Run `mach-operator-node`

    Please refer to the doc: [RunOperator](https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs/blob/m2-dev/docs/RunOperator.md)

#### Run the whole system in local testnet

For the setup of operator, It is the same process as "Run as Operator"

Before you run the operator, you need to deploy the contract and run tthe aggregator.

1. Deploy the contracts in local network:

    [Script For Testing AVS Contracts](https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs/blob/m2-dev/scripts/README.md)

2. Run the aggregator:

    [RunAggregator](https://github.com/alt-research/mach-avs/blob/m2-dev/docs/RunAggregator.md)

3. Run `mach-operator-verifier` is same as above

4. Run `mach-operator-node`

    Please set the corrent the aggregator endpoint and related info from `1` step.
